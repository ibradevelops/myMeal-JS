# myMeal-JS
After cloning this project, in the terminal type 'cd myMeal-JS' and then 'npm install bootstrap'
myMeal project is web app where users can create account, get inspiration of what should they eat,
save their meals, share their meals, and also see meals that other users shared.
I used rest services for data, this application is made mostly to demonstrate my knowledge.
This app is not supported on smaller devices like tablets or phones
